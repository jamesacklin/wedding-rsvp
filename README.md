# Wedding RSVP

A webapp to solicit wedding RSVPs given a pre-populated MySQL table. The thinking here is that an "invitation" does not exactly mean number of guestsâ€”which need to have their meal preferences and attendance accounted for.

Invitees will receive a printed invitation in the mail with a "Guest Number," which corresponds to a primary key in the table.

There are obviously better ways to do this (snail mail + SASEs, Google Forms / Sheets, MailChimp, et al) but I want to build this from the bottom up and make it extensible to other dev's weddings. Hopefully I can build a nice front-end to make checking up on RSVP status easier.

Inspired in part by (Jonnie Hallman's post)[http://destroytoday.com/blog/wedding-tech/] on the tech for his wedding.
